# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Bug that caused classification to not work when k-mer length was equal
  to minimizer length

## [2.1.1] - 2020-11-08

### Fixed
- Compilation error with GCC 10, omission of cstdint header
- Removed --skip-maps from standard install due to addition of plasmids,
  which require acc/taxid maps

## [2.1.0] - 2020-10-13

### Added
- Small viral reference set and read simulator for future testing
- Build options to aid testing
- Integration of HLL to estimate distinct minimizer counts

### Changed
- Build code now creates databases with deterministic MD5 sums by default;
  --fast-build option to kraken2-build introduced to access old behavior
- Added plasmid library to standard installation set
- Updated SILVA to release 138.1

### Fixed
- Modified build code to prevent insertion of minimizers with ambiguous bases
- Bug where hit list output in quick mode used internal taxid (not external)
- No more attempts to download "na" paths from FTP site
- Runaway memory usage bug with unpaired classification (thanks to D. Cameron)
- Modified estimation code to better handle small reference libraries

## [2.0.9] - 2020-04-07 (beta)

### Added
- Expose --load-factor setting to kraken2-build
- New --minimum-hit-groups option to kraken2

### Changed
- Require 2 hit groups (set of overlapping k-mers w/ same minimizer) to
  make classification by default
- Allow build options to pass through to subsequent invocations (e.g.,
  k-mer length for 16S DBs)
- Removed env options for library downloads (no longer available from
  same NCBI location)
- Updated SILVA to release 138

### Fixed
- Removed mention of --fastq-input from Manual
- Made PE read identifier suffix trimming more restrictive (only on /1 and /2)
- Bug where some reads would be classified with taxid 0
- Bug that didn't allow kraken2-inspect to work with large databases

## [2.0.8] - 2019-04-25 (beta)

### Added
- FTP downloading option for taxonomy/libraries (--use-ftp for kraken2-build)
- Option to skip downloading taxonomy maps

### Changed
- Added lookup table to speed up parsing in MinimizerScanner class
- Default parameters for minimizer lengths and spaces changed (spaces=7 for
  nucleotide search, length=12 for translated search)

### Fixed
- Linked space expansion value for proteins to constant used by MinimizerScanner
- Reporting of taxids in classified-out sequence files
- Confidence scoring bug associated with failure to leave some sequences
  unclassified
- Reverse complement shifting bug, code made backwards-compatible with
  existing databases (newly created DBs will have fix)
- NCBI taxonomy download error due to removal of EST/GSS files

## [2.0.7] - 2018-08-11 (beta)

### Added
- Disk usage info to kraken2-build --clean
- Memory allocation error message for hash table
- Option for --max-db-size and hash downsampling
- Multithreading to kraken2-inspect

### Changed
- Move to /usr/bin/env for perl scripts
- Add DB loading message to keep people from killing processes early
- Add flag files for resuming download of nucleotide accession map data
- Converted lookup_accession_numbers script into C++ program w/ memory mapping
- Clarified in manual that one or more libraries allowed for custom DBs
- Silenced progress messages in C++ programs for non-TTY stderr
- Taxonomy downloads switched to rsync from wget (ftp)
- Removed '%' from reports

### Fixed
- Allow d/l of protozoa library w/ kraken2-build script
- Filenames for SILVA database taxonomy info
- Typo in manual for output format example
- Corrected default space count in manual
- Removed obvious race condition in --add-to-library functionality
- Corrected behavior of --classified-out and --unclassified-out (no longer
  forcing .fq/.fa file extensions, respecting '#' in paired mode)
- Usage message in kraken2-inspect
- Taxonomy creation for 16S databases

## [2.0.6] - 2018-06-13 (beta)

### Changed
- New DB summary info printed out w/ inspect script + --skip-counts option

### Fixed
- Now stripping carriage returns and other trailing whitespace from sequence
  data
- Treating l-mers immediately following ambiguous characters as ambiguous
  until a full k-mer is processed
- Bug in expansion of spaced seed masks that left spaces at end

## [2.0.5] - 2018-05-21 (beta)

### Added
- New kraken2-inspect script to report minimizer counts per taxon

### Changed
- Kraken 2X build now adds terminators to all reference sequences

## [2.0.4] - 2018-05-06 (beta)

### Fixed
- Improved portability to older g++ by removing initialization of
  variable-length string.

## [2.0.3] - 2018-02-12 (alpha)

### Added
- Reporting options to kraken2 script (like Kraken 1's kraken-report and
  kraken-mpa-report)

### Changed
- Made loading to RAM default option, added --memory-mapping option to kraken2

## [2.0.2] - 2018-02-04 (alpha)

### Added
- Low base quality masking option

### Changed
- Moved low-complexity masking to library download/addition, out of build
  process
- Made no masking default for human genome in standard installation

## [2.0.1] - 2018-01-01 (alpha)

### Added
- Low-complexity sequence masking as a default
- UniVec/UniVec_Core databases to supported downloads
- UniVec_Core & human in standard Kraken 2 DB
- 16S DB support (Greengenes, Silva, RDP)

- Operating manual

### Fixed
- kraken2 now allows compression & paired processing at same time

## [2.0.0] - 2017-12-04 (alpha, initial release)
